Short educational document meant to teach biologists better practices for sample annotation spreadsheet creation.

<br/>

# The Problem

Frustration. Biologists (and similar) often requests the help of bioinformaticians (or similar) in order to get data analyzed. As part of this interaction the biologist will often provide a document with the information about the samples and their attributes, "the sample annotation spreadsheet". Unfortunately, the biologist has often made a lot of silly and not well thought through choices when creating the sample annotation. Both the bioinformatician and the computer get confused. The problematic annotation may already have propagated into raw and intermediate data files. The computer may make mistakes and the bioinformatician get frustrated. 

<br/>

# The Solution

Awareness. Even though it may be too late for the current project, it is still time to improve and avoid troubles in the biologist's next projects. The bioinformatician sends a polite email to the biologist, pointing to the unfortunate choices and referring to the ["Better Practices"](https://www.elixir-norway.org/uploads/sample_annotation_better_practices.html) web page. See [example email](example_email.txt). The ambition is that the biologist, the next time a sample annotation file is initiated, will remember that things matters and consult the "Better Practices" page.

# Use

The document is hosted on elixir-norways web pages, https://www.elixir-norway.org/uploads/sample_annotation_better_practices.html.
Any frustrated bioinformatician is welcome to use this by referring the biologist to it or make their own version. Suggestions for improvements can be done through this github repository or by contacting vegard.nygaard@medisin.uio.no
