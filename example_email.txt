Dear Brenda the Biologist,

I have started looking into your project. There seems to be a small inconsistency with the sample Ids you have used; "Sample 1", "Sample-7", "Sample13" and "42". I assume these unfortunate names are now part of other files and it may be to late to fix this. I will be able to work through this, but for your next project I recommend you spend some extra minutes making the sample ids more consistent. Read more about the possible problems with "Inconsistent sample identifiers" and "Naming" here:

Hopefully your next project will start out with a more tidy sample annotation which will decrease time needed to sort out ambiguities and decrease the chances for later errors like sample mix-ups.

Yours sincerely, Ben the Bioinformatician
